Keyword: Boardwalk

(Boardwalk by Herbert Morris)

My breath, turned smoke, is rising on the air.
In the background, not completely in focus,
lies the resort itself (the sea unseen),
a mise-en-scène of small shops, baths, hotels,
lining the boardwalk; a few scattered figures,
fading to haze, to blur, loom in the distance,
early walkers like us, although it seems
we have the boardwalk largely to ourselves.



Keyword: Marsh

(Song of Myself by Walt Whitman)

Where band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out,

Where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery,

Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,

Where the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,

Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon



Keyword: Sky

(I Dwell in Possibility by Emily Dickinson)

Of Chambers as the Cedars –

Impregnable of eye –

And for an everlasting Roof

The Gambrels of the Sky



Keyword: Water

(The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge)

Water, water, every where,

And all the boards did shrink;

Water, water, every where,

Nor any drop to drink
