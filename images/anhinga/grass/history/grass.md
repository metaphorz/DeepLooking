St. Augustine grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) takes its name from St. Augustine, Florida — the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the United States, founded by Spanish explorers in 1565. The grass was first documented growing in the sandy soils around the settlement and became the dominant warm-season turf across the Gulf Coast and southeastern states.
