St. Augustine grass spreads exclusively through stolons — horizontal above-ground stems called runners. Unlike many grasses, it produces no rhizomes (underground stems) and rarely spreads by seed. The stolons creep along the soil surface, rooting at each node to form new plants. This aggressive lateral growth allows St. Augustine grass to form a dense, carpet-like turf that crowds out weeds and quickly repairs bare patches in North Florida lawns.
