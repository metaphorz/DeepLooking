Each pond in the chain is connected by control structures — typically weirs or orifice pipes — that regulate the flow rate between basins. The first pond acts as a forebay, trapping sediment and heavy debris. Subsequent ponds provide progressively finer filtration. Outflow elevations are staggered so gravity drives the cascade, and emergency spillways handle extreme storm events to prevent overtopping.
