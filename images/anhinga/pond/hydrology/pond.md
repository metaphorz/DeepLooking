A retention pond chain is a series of interconnected basins designed to manage stormwater by capturing runoff, reducing flood peaks, and filtering pollutants sequentially. By linking ponds, excess water flows from one to the next, maximizing storage, improving water quality, and providing robust downstream protection.
