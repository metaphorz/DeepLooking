Retention ponds in North Florida support rich ecosystems. Wading birds like the anhinga, great blue heron, and snowy egret hunt fish along the margins. Submerged vegetation and algae oxygenate the water while filtering nutrients. Turtles, frogs, and dragonflies colonize the littoral shelves, and the pond chain's varied depths create microhabitats that sustain biodiversity far beyond what a single basin could support.
