The anhinga possesses a unique S-shaped neck with a distinctive kink at the 8th–9th cervical vertebrae. This specialized joint acts as a hinge mechanism, enabling the bird to thrust its dagger-like bill forward with extraordinary speed to spear fish underwater. Unlike most waterbirds, the anhinga lacks waterproof plumage oil glands — its feathers become waterlogged when diving, reducing buoyancy for deeper pursuit. This explains the characteristic wing-drying posture visible in the photograph, where the bird spreads its wings to air-dry after fishing.
