The word "anhinga" derives from the Old Tupi language of Brazilian Indian tribes, meaning "devil bird" or "evil spirit of the woods." The anhinga is also known as the "water turkey" due to its broad, fan-shaped tail resembling a wild turkey's, and the "snake bird" because when swimming, only its long, sinuous neck is visible above the water, giving the appearance of a snake gliding across the surface.
