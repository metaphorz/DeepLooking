G35 in Gardiner's sign list represents the cormorant, an ancient Egyptian hieroglyph used as a logogram and determinative. The anhinga (family Anhingidae) and cormorant (family Phalacrocoracidae) are closely related, sharing the Order Suliformes. Both are expert diving birds with similar body plans — long necks, hooked bills, and webbed feet adapted for underwater pursuit of fish.
