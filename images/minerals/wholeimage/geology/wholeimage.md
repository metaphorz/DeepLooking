Heavy minerals (specific gravity 3.5–5.2) lag behind lighter quartz grains (2.65) as waves wash back down the beach face. Repeated swash cycles concentrate the dark grains into visible streaks and layers on the beach surface. This natural density sorting is the same principle used in gold panning — heavier particles settle while lighter ones are carried away by the water.
