Hold a small magnet near the dark grains. Magnetite leaps to the magnet and clings firmly — it is strongly magnetic. Ilmenite rotates or slides slowly toward it — weakly magnetic, rich in titanium. Rutile and zircon show no response at all. This simple field test separates the four main heavy minerals found on North Florida beaches like Talbot Island.
